### Goal

Create a simple web portal as a college minor project.
It will track health data for:

* Eligible couples (EC)
* Pregnant women (PW)
* Children up to 18 months

It is currently a data entry platform and will show basic statistics and data.
Fully online; no offline support or synchronization.

### What it does

* Collects and stores data in its own database
* Lets users add, edit, and view records
* Enforces role-based access (ASHA, ANM, Supervisors)
* Works as a standalone demo of how such a system might look

### What it doesnâ€™t do

* No integration with RCH, HMIS, or government APIs
* Not meant to replace existing systems
* Offline data entry not supported
* Mother view feature not yet implemented
* Built only for learning and demonstration

### Who's going to use

* ASHA, ANM, Supervisors for editing and viewing data
