### 🩺 Health Data Web Portal – Minor Project

#### 📌 Goal

Create a simple web portal as a college minor project to track health data for:

* Eligible Couples (EC)
* Pregnant Women (PW)
* Children up to 18 months

It will act as a **data entry and basic analytics platform**, showing counts and basic stats — fully online, no offline sync.

---

### ⚙️ Tech Stack

**Frontend:**

* **HTML5** – structure and layout
* **CSS3** – styling and responsive design
* **JavaScript (ES6+)** – client-side logic
* **React.js** – UI components, routing, state management

**Backend:**

* **Node.js** – runtime environment
* **Express.js** – server-side routing and API handling
* **MySQL** – relational database for storing structured data
* **React.js** – (used in frontend but part of overall MERN-like stack)

---

### ✅ What It Does

* Collects and stores data in its own database
* Allows users to **add, edit, and view** records
* Enforces **role-based access** (ASHA, ANM, Supervisor)
* Serves as a **demo system** showing how such portals can function

---

### 🚫 What It Doesn’t Do

* No integration with government systems (RCH, HMIS, APIs)
* Not meant as a production-grade replacement
* No offline entry or sync support
* “Mother view” feature not implemented yet
* Built purely for **learning and demonstration**

---

### 👤 Intended Users

* ASHA Workers
* ANMs (Health Workers)
* Supervisors (Health Officials)
