### Goal

Create a simple web portal as a college minor project.
It will track health data for:

* Eligible couples
* Pregnant women
* Children up to 18 months

Its currently a data entry platform and it will show some basic statistics and data.

Currently we are only using it as simple platform, fully online, no offline support.

### What it does

* Collects and stores data in its own database
* Lets users add, edit, and view records
* Works as a standalone demo of how such a system might look

### What it doesnâ€™t do

* No integration with RCH, HMIS, or government APIs
* Not meant to replace existing systems
* Built only for learning and demonstration

### Who's going to use

* ASHA, ANM, Supervisiors for editing and viewing data
